# ðŸ›  Troubleshooting and Maintenance Guide

This document outlines common issues, debugging tips, and maintenance practices for keeping AI Nexus Herald reliable and efficient.

## ðŸ”Ž Troubleshooting
### 1. System Does Not Start
- **Check environment setup**: Ensure Python and required dependencies are installed.
- **Logs**: Look into the backend logs for information and errors.
- **Configuration files**: Confirm .env and config files are correctly set.

### 2. Newsletter Not Generated
- **Agent execution**: Ensure each agent in the workflow (Topic Finder, Deep Researcher, Newsletter Writer) executed successfully.
- **Check intermediate outputs**: If one agent fails, inspect its raw output for malformed data.
- **Monitoring**: Check LangSmith traces for tracking and potential errors.

### 3. Incorrect or Empty Newsletter Content
- **Topic Finder Agent tuning**: Check that the model isnâ€™t overly restrictive in selecting trending topics.
- **Deep Research Agent validation**: Ensure correct filtering logic is applied to fetch relevant news articles.
- **LLM prompt drift**: Review the Newsletter Writer Agentâ€™s prompt instructions for clarity.

### 4. Performance Issues / System Crashes
- **High API load**: Throttle or batch requests to external APIs (e.g., Hugging Face, Groq).
- **Memory usage**: If large numbers of news articles are ingested, use chunking and caching.
- **Scaling**: Consider containerization (Docker) if running in production.


## ðŸ”§ Maintenance
### Regular Tasks
- **Update RSS feeds**: Refresh the feed source list every 2â€“3 months to avoid dead links.
- **API keys and tokens**: Rotate keys periodically and update .env securely.
- **Dependency updates**: Keep Python library versions up-to-date for security and compatibility.
- **Model quality checks**: Periodically validate the LLM outputs for relevance and accuracy.

### Monitoring
- **Logging**: Ensure structured logs are enabled for each workflow node/agent.
- **Alerts**: Set up alerts for failed workflows or API request errors.
- **Health checks**: Run test newsletters weekly to ensure pipeline integrity.

### Backup & Recovery
- **Config backup**: Regularly back up .env, config files, and RSS feed lists.
- **Disaster recovery**: Maintain a lightweight local version of the system for emergency runs.
