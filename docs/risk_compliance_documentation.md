## ✅ 1. System Purpose & Context

### 🎯 Intended Use

**AI Nexus Herald** is a modular, multi-agent AI system designed to generate professional newsletters on trending topics in artificial intelligence. It is intended for use by:

- AI analysts and research teams
- Content publishers producing AI-focused newsletters
- Business and technical teams interested in curated AI news

The system is not intended for:

- Personalized or sensitive decision-making
- Generating financial, legal, or medical advice
- High-stakes or regulated domains involving PII, PHI, or legal compliance

### ⚠️ Limitations

- Does not validate factual correctness of external news sources beyond semantic alignment
- Content may reflect biases present in source data (e.g., RSS articles)
- System performance is bounded by LLM limitations (e.g., hallucinations, misattributions)
- No built-in real-time misinformation detection

### 👥 User Boundaries

- End users should not rely on outputs for legal, medical, or investment decisions
- Editorial review is strongly recommended before public release
- Not suitable for unsupervised deployment in high-risk environments

## ✅ 2. System Architecture

### 📐 Technical Overview

AI Nexus Herald is structured around a **LangGraph-powered multi-agent architecture**, supported by an API and UI frontend.

#### Core Components

| Component               | Description                                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **TopicFinderAgent**   | Identifies relevant topics from AI-related RSS feeds           |
| **DeepResearchAgent**  | Gathers relevant context and reference data per topic          |
| **NewsletterWriterAgent** | Composes markdown newsletter from researched content         |
| **LangGraph Orchestrator** | Manages agent workflow and state             |
| **FastAPI Backend**    | API to trigger generation and manage outputs                   |
| **Streamlit UI**       | Frontend to interact with the newsletter generation process    |
| **Groq API**           | Underlying LLM infrastructure for all agent prompts            |
| **Guardrails AI**      | Output validation layer to enforce structural and safety rules |
| **DeepEval**   | Output evaluation and scoring framework                        |

#### 🔄 Data Flow

RSS Feeds --> Topic Finder --> Deep Researcher --> Newsletter Writer --> Markdown Output


#### 📦 Dependencies

- Python 3.12
- LangGraph, LangChain
- Groq (LLM APIs)
- OpenAI (LLM APIs)
- DeepEval
- Guardrails AI
- FastAPI / Streamlit
- dotenv, pydantic, requests

## ✅ 3. Evaluation

### 🧠 Reasoning Strategy

- Prompt engineering ensures each agent performs a bounded, well-defined role
- Each stage is contextually dependent on validated outputs of the previous agent
- Models use deterministic prompts wherever possible (structured outputs, enums, bullet lists)

### 🧾 Data Sources

- Publicly available RSS feeds (e.g., ScienceDaily, MIT Technology Review, VentureBeat, TheGradient)
- Each article title/description is parsed and filtered for topical relevance

### 🧪 Validation Methods

| Phase            | Technique                          | Tool Used       |
|------------------|------------------------------------|------------------|
| Topic Relevance  | Semantic similarity filtering       |DeepEval |
| Factual Integrity| Source URL alignment and summarization | Manual + LLM-based |
| Output Quality   | Structure + Relevance scoring       | DeepEval, Guardrails |
| Workflow         | End-to-end LangGraph tracing        | LangSmith |

### 🛡️ Safety Testing

- Guardrails schema enforces structure (no toxic language, banned words)
- Prompt constraints ensure the model remains within factual, informative tone
- LLM calls monitored for token limits, undefined behaviors, and unsafe content patterns

### 📉 Bias & Fairness Considerations

- Sources chosen for diversity (multiple organizations, regions)
- No personalization reduces risk of demographic bias
- Known limitation: bias in source content may propagate to generated outputs

---

## ✅ 4. Operations & Observability

### 🪵 Logging

- Each agent logs:
  - Agent Prompt
  - System Output 
  - LangGraph workflow along with agent and tool calls
  - Errors or deviations
- Logs stored in `outputs/logs` directory with timestamps

### 📊 Monitoring & Auditing

- LangGraph supports execution tracing via LangSmith
- Evaluation metrics (relevance, faithfulness, coherence) stored in `.json` and `DeepEval` summary reports
- Guardrails errors trigger fallback or retry mechanisms
- Test coverage for:
  - Agent prompt correctness
  - Output structure conformity
  - Cross-agent traceability

## ✅ 5. Maintenance & Lifecycle

### 🔄 Post-Deployment Monitoring

| Aspect                | Strategy                            |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Quality Drift          | Regular metric checks (DeepEval)    |
| LLM Behavior Change    | Prompt regression tests             |
| Source Validity        | Update and verify RSS links monthly |
| Prompt Tuning          | Based on user feedback or evals     |
| Guardrails Drift       | Schema updates and policy checks    |

### 🛠️ Governance Procedures

- Manual review loop before release to mailing lists
- All generated newsletters stored in version-controlled `/outputs/newsletters/`
- Evaluation suite run before each major release
- System triggers alerts if guardrails fail or topic extraction returns empty

## 🧩 Known Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                  | Mitigation Strategy                                  |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Hallucinated or outdated content      | Use of RSS sources + Guardrails AI for validation   |
| Biased or narrow perspectives         | Use of diverse AI sources                           |
| LLM output variability                | Use structured prompts + determinism where possible |
| System failure or agent crash         | Logs, retries, and LangGraph state handling         |
| Mismatch between research and topics  | Semantic similarity checks + DeepEval testing       |
